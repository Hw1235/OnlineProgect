**_Remainder_**

- Let's imagine you want to equally distribute 100 balls in boxes. Each box contains only 3 balls. How many balls will be left over?

- In other words, we need to calculate the remainder of 100 divided by 3, which is done using the modulo operator %.

  - So, let's find out the answer:

  ```js
  let balls = 100;
  let boxes = 3;
  console.log(balls % boxes);
  ```
