**_Increment_**

- Sometimes we need to repeatedly add 1 to a variable.

  - For example, when counting attempts in a game, or the number of clicks on a web page.
  - This can be done using the increment (++) operator:

  ```js
  let count = 0;
  count++;
  console.log(count);
  ```

- Incrementing a value using the ++ operator
  - Ans: Add 1 to it.
